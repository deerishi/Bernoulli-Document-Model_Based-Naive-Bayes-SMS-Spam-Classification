The Maximum A posteriori Parameter Estimation Technique was used to compute the word Probabilities. The Beta distribution with Beta(2,1) was used as a prior.\r\n\r\nThe Preproceesing part involved the following steps :\r\n    \r\n    1)Removal of trailing spaces\r\n\r\n    2)Removal of Non Words\r\n\r\n    3)Removal of Stop Words\r\n\r\n    4)Lemmatization\r\n\r\n    \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
